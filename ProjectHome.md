JavaXPCOM has very little and somewhat obsoleted documentation. This project's goal is to provide annotated and working examples  using this technology, as well as to create and organize a documentation website about JavaXPCOM and related topics ( XulRunner, integration with Eclipse, ATF, mozilla.dev.tech.java...)
